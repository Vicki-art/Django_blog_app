Hello, World!
Nice to see you on my Blog App which was developed as a portfolio application using Django Framework.

This App was finished and deployed to a web server in January 2024.
Since 2025 it has been available only through GitHub. 

It implements following features:
- Posts. Supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions. Provides links to individual post's page and author page where all posts of a certain author are collected.

- Pagination. Post's list is paginated.

- Registration form. You can register by entering username and email.

- Login / Logout. Standard features for apps of this type.

- Profile page. Here you can view and update personal data and set a profile image.

- Password reset. Password reset is to be made by sending a link to the user's email.
